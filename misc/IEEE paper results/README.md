Please note that the contents of this directory correspond to the source code used to produce the results presented in the paper [Adaptive Training of Grid-Dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10763509).

This code corresponds to a much older version of `jaxKAN`, therefore the notebooks are going to produce errors if run on the current version. You can either revert back to an older version (not recommended), or follow the [jaxKAN tutorials](https://jaxkan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html) to see how the code can be adapted to the current version (recommended).
